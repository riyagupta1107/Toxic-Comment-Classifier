# Toxic-Comment-Classifier
This project builds a real-time Toxic Comment Classifier that detects whether a given message is toxic or non-toxic. It uses text preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, and a Logistic Regression model. The system is deployed with Streamlit, allowing users to type any message and instantly get the prediction.
